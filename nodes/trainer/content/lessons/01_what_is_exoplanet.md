# What is an Exoplanet?

An **exoplanet** (short for "extrasolar planet") is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. These distant worlds come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny rocky planets smaller than Earth to massive gas giants many times larger than Jupiter.

## A Brief History

For centuries, humans wondered whether other stars had planets. It wasn't until **1995** that astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz discovered the first exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star: **51 Pegasi b**.

This discovery was so important that it earned them the **2019 Nobel Prize in Physics**!

Since then, we've discovered over **5,000 confirmed exoplanets**, with thousands more candidates waiting to be verified.

## Types of Exoplanets

Exoplanets come in several main categories:

### Hot Jupiters
- Gas giants orbiting very close to their stars
- Complete an orbit in just a few days
- Surface temperatures can exceed 1000°C
- Example: 51 Pegasi b, WASP-76b

### Super-Earths
- Rocky planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune
- Mass between 2-10 Earth masses
- May be rocky, icy, or have thick atmospheres
- Example: Kepler-442b, LHS 1140b

### Mini-Neptunes
- Small, gas-rich planets
- Common in our galaxy but absent in our solar system
- Often found between Super-Earth and Neptune sizes
- Example: Kepler-11b through f

### Earth-like Planets
- Rocky planets similar in size to Earth
- Located in the habitable zone
- Could potentially support liquid water
- Example: TRAPPIST-1e, Proxima Centauri b

## Why Study Exoplanets?

Studying exoplanets helps us answer fundamental questions:

1. **Are we alone?** Some exoplanets might have conditions suitable for life.

2. **How do planets form?** Each new discovery teaches us about planetary system formation.

3. **Is Earth special?** Understanding other planets helps us appreciate our own.

4. **Where might we find life?** We can identify the most promising targets for biosignature searches.

## Key Points

- An exoplanet is a planet orbiting a star other than our Sun
- Over 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed since 1995
- Exoplanets come in many types: Hot Jupiters, Super-Earths, Mini-Neptunes, and more
- Finding exoplanets helps us understand planet formation and search for life
