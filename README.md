# AstroTinyML

TinyML-powered spectral data analysis for astronomical research. Process NASA data, detect exoplanets, and generate submission-ready reports.

## Overview

AstroTinyML explores the intersection of embedded machine learning (TinyML) and space/astronomy applications, enabling intelligent edge computing for:

- Satellite anomaly detection
- Space sensor data processing
- Astronomical event classification
- Exoplanet detection from spectral data
- Low-power embedded inference for space missions
